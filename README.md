# Nasa-Challenge-2025
## Summary
We developed a web platform integrated with a machine learning model that automates the classification of exoplanets using data from missions such as TESS and Kepler. Currently, exoplanet classification requires a lot of manual effort by scientists, which is time-consuming and can produce errors. Our solution addresses this challenge by allowing users to input data points, which are processed through our trained model to predict one of six categories. This automation not only saves valuable research time and reduces errors but also makes exoplanet hunting more accessible to non-experts. By streamlining the process, our project enhances scientific productivity and accelerates the discovery. 
What does our solution address? 
Despite that Data collectors like TESS and Kepler provide high quality and open-source datasets, there are huge amounts of manual processing do by scientists to identify exoplanets and classify them. This manual method is time consuming, puts pressure on labor, and can lead to human error. With the rise of machine learning technology, there is strong potential to adapt an automated approach to classify exoplanets using appropriate preprocessing methods and choosing the right machine learning models. 
## What is our Solution
Our project is a website that is powered by machine learning, designed to be easy to use for scientists and anyone interested in hunting for exoplanets. Simply, the user will input data as datapoints into the website and then the data will be transferred to our model in order to classify the datapoint as one of six categories (ambiguous planetary candidates [APC], Confirmed Exoplanets [CP], Planetary Candidates [PC], False Positives [FP], Known Planets [KP], FA). We trained our model on the TESS dataset  then we integrated it with the website. Our model is a supervised machine learning model that will accept 18 features that we extracted using a recursive feature selection method the model will then predict the class to which the inputs tend to belong.
This solution is a pain reliefer for exoplanets hunters.
•	It saves scientists time by reducing the need for manual classification.
•	It minimizes human error by using a consistent, automated approach.
•	It makes exoplanet hunting more accessible, even to non-experts.
•	It scales well to handle the large amounts of data generated by telescopes like Kepler and TESS.
## Our goal
Our program is an effective resource for astronomers embarking on missions looking for exoplanets, for making the workflow of research easier, as well as for encouraging more people to participate in astrophysics by making the process not complex or exclusive for only scientists’ use. In the long run, our long-term aspiration is enhancing scientific productivity as well as accelerating discovery.
## Tools used
1. Programming Languages & Libraries
•	Python: We used it for data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning
•	Pandas: We used it for data manipulation and preprocessing
•	Numpy: We used it for numerical computations
•	scikit-learn: We used it for splitting the data, testing different models, and evaluating the models. 
•	Joblib: we used this library to load the model in the backend
2. Software
•	Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for development and experimentation.
3. Dataset
•	TESS dataset (NASA resource): this was the primary dataset used for training and testing the model
4. Web Development
The CosmoCore interface was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask. The frontend was designed with HTML to structure the form and layout, CSS to style the visual elements, and JavaScript to handle dynamic behavior such as submitting the form without reloading the page and displaying the prediction result in real-time. The backend was developed in Python using the Flask framework, which serves the web interface, processes user input, and communicates with a trained machine learning model (saved using joblib) to generate predictions. This full-stack approach allows for an interactive, AI-powered experience entirely in the browser.
5. Version Control & Hosting
•	GitHub: Used for repository hosting and version control
